# Constructor-Hangman
Command Line Hangman game using constructor functions - Homework #9

This node.js application is a command line Hangman game. The computer chooses a random word from a text file and prompts the user to select letters in order to guess the word. As correct letters are guessed, the letters are filled in. The user has 10 incorrect guesses available. When the user guesses the word or incorrect guesses are no longer available, the game ends. The user can then choose to play another game. Also, the user can type quit at any time to end the game and leave the application altogether.
